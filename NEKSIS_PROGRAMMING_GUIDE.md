## Getting Started {#getting-started}

### What You Need
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- The Neksis compiler (comes with this repository)

### Quick Setup
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the Neksis folder
3. You're ready to code!

### Running Your First Program
```bash
# In the Neksis directory:
cargo run --bin neksis -- your_program.nx
```

---

## Your First Program {#your-first-program}

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This is tradition in programming - your first program should greet the world!

**Create file: `hello.nx`**
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

**Run it:**
```bash
cargo run --bin neksis -- hello.nx
```

**You'll see:**
```
Hello, World!
```

### Understanding Your First Program

Let's break down what each part does:

- `fn main() -> Int` - This declares a function named "main" that returns an integer
- `{` and `}` - These curly braces group code together
- `println("Hello, World!");` - This prints text to the screen
- `return 0;` - This tells the program it finished successfully

**Think of it like this:** Every Neksis program is like a recipe. The `main` function is where the cooking starts. The `println` is like an instruction to "announce what you're making," and `return 0` is like saying "the recipe is complete!"

---

## Variables and Basic Types {#variables-and-basic-types}

Variables are like labeled boxes where you store information. In Neksis, you need to tell the computer what type of information goes in each box.

### Basic Types

**Integers (Whole Numbers)**
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let age: Int = 25;
    let year: Int = 2024;
    let temperature: Int = 72;
    
    println("Age: " + age);
    println("Year: " + year);
    println("Temperature: " + temperature);
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Strings (Text)**
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let name: String = "Alice";
    let city: String = "New York";
    let hobby: String = "Programming";
    
    println("Name: " + name);
    println("City: " + city);
    println("Hobby: " + hobby);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Understanding Variables

Think of variables like labeled containers:
- `let name: String = "Alice"` creates a container labeled "name" that holds text, and puts "Alice" in it
- `let age: Int = 25` creates a container labeled "age" that holds numbers, and puts 25 in it

The `: Int` or `: String` part tells Neksis what type of container it is, so it knows how to handle what's inside.

---

## Working with Numbers {#working-with-numbers}

Numbers are fundamental in programming. Let's learn to do math with Neksis!

### Basic Arithmetic
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let a: Int = 10;
    let b: Int = 5;
    
    let sum: Int = a + b;
    let difference: Int = a - b;
    let product: Int = a * b;
    let quotient: Int = a / b;
    
    println("10 + 5 = " + sum);
    println("10 - 5 = " + difference);
    println("10 * 5 = " + product);
    println("10 / 5 = " + quotient);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Real-World Example: Calculating Area
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Room Area Calculator ===");
    
    let length: Int = 12;
    let width: Int = 10;
    let area: Int = length * width;
    
    println("Room dimensions:");
    println("Length: " + length + " feet");
    println("Width: " + width + " feet");
    println("Total area: " + area + " square feet");
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Why This is Useful:** Imagine you're helping someone figure out how much carpet they need, or how much paint to buy. This program does the math for you!

---

## Text and Strings {#text-and-strings}

Strings are how we work with text. In Neksis, you can combine strings and numbers easily.

### Basic String Operations
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let first_name: String = "John";
    let last_name: String = "Smith";
    let age: Int = 30;
    
    // Combining strings and numbers
    println("First name: " + first_name);
    println("Last name: " + last_name);
    println("Age: " + age + " years old");
    
    // Building sentences
    println(first_name + " " + last_name + " is " + age + " years old");
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Practical Example: Creating a Business Card
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Digital Business Card ===");
    
    let name: String = "Sarah Johnson";
    let title: String = "Software Developer";
    let company: String = "Tech Solutions Inc";
    let phone: String = "555-0123";
    let email: String = "sarah.johnson@techsolutions.com";
    
    println("╔════════════════════════════════╗");
    println("║ " + name);
    println("║ " + title);
    println("║ " + company);
    println("║");
    println("║ Phone: " + phone);
    println("║ Email: " + email);
    println("╚════════════════════════════════╝");
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Making Decisions {#making-decisions}

Programs need to make decisions. "If this, then that." Neksis uses `if` and `else` for this.

### Basic If-Else
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let temperature: Int = 75;
    
    if temperature >= 80 {
        println("It's hot outside!");
    } else {
        println("It's not too hot today.");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Multiple Conditions
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let score: Int = 85;
    
    println("Your test score: " + score);
    
    if score >= 90 {
        println("Grade: A - Excellent!");
    } else if score >= 80 {
        println("Grade: B - Good job!");
    } else if score >= 70 {
        println("Grade: C - Not bad!");
    } else if score >= 60 {
        println("Grade: D - You passed!");
    } else {
        println("Grade: F - Study harder next time!");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Real-World Example: Age Checker
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Age Verification System ===");
    
    let age: Int = 17;
    let name: String = "Alex";
    
    println("Checking age for: " + name);
    println("Age: " + age);
    
    if age >= 21 {
        println("✅ " + name + " can enter the bar");
        println("✅ " + name + " can drink alcohol");
    } else if age >= 18 {
        println("✅ " + name + " can enter the bar");
        println("❌ " + name + " cannot drink alcohol");
    } else {
        println("❌ " + name + " cannot enter the bar");
        println("❌ " + name + " cannot drink alcohol");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Every app you use makes decisions like this. Instagram checks if you're logged in before showing your feed. Your bank app checks if you have enough money before allowing a transfer.

---

## Loops and Repetition {#loops-and-repetition}

Sometimes you need to do the same thing multiple times. Loops handle this for you.

### Basic While Loop
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("Counting from 1 to 5:");
    
    let count: Int = 1;
    while count <= 5 {
        println("Count: " + count);
        count = count + 1;
    }
    
    println("Done counting!");
    return 0;
}
```

### Practical Example: Multiplication Table
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Multiplication Table for 7 ===");
    
    let number: Int = 7;
    let i: Int = 1;
    
    while i <= 10 {
        let result: Int = number * i;
        println(number + " × " + i + " = " + result);
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Real-World Example: Savings Calculator
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Savings Growth Calculator ===");
    
    let monthly_savings: Int = 500;
    let months: Int = 12;
    let month: Int = 1;
    let total_saved: Int = 0;
    
    println("Saving $" + monthly_savings + " per month:");
    
    while month <= months {
        total_saved = total_saved + monthly_savings;
        println("Month " + month + ": $" + total_saved + " saved");
        month = month + 1;
    }
    
    println("After " + months + " months, you'll have $" + total_saved + "!");
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Real-Life Connection:** This is like your savings app showing you how your money grows over time, or a fitness app tracking your daily steps.

## Functions - Building Blocks {#functions}

Functions are like tools in a toolbox. Each one does a specific job, and you can use them whenever you need them.

### Creating Your First Function
```rust
fn greet_person(name: String) -> Int {
    println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    println("Welcome to Neksis programming!");
    return 0;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    greet_person("Alice");
    greet_person("Bob");
    greet_person("Charlie");
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Functions That Return Values
```rust
fn add_numbers(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    let result: Int = a + b;
    return result;
}

fn multiply_numbers(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    let product: Int = x * y;
    return product;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Calculator Functions ===");
    
    let sum: Int = add_numbers(15, 25);
    let product: Int = multiply_numbers(6, 7);
    
    println("15 + 25 = " + sum);
    println("6 × 7 = " + product);
    
    // You can use functions in calculations too!
    let combined: Int = add_numbers(sum, product);
    println("Sum + Product = " + combined);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Real-World Example: Temperature Converter
```rust
fn celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius: Int) -> Int {
    let fahrenheit: Int = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
    return fahrenheit;
}

fn fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit: Int) -> Int {
    let celsius: Int = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
    return celsius;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Temperature Converter ===");
    
    let temp_c: Int = 25;
    let temp_f: Int = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_c);
    
    println(temp_c + "°C = " + temp_f + "°F");
    
    let temp_f2: Int = 77;
    let temp_c2: Int = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f2);
    
    println(temp_f2 + "°F = " + temp_c2 + "°C");
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Why Functions Are Amazing:** Instead of writing the same temperature conversion math over and over, you write it once in a function and use it anywhere. It's like having a calculator that remembers your favorite formulas!

---

## Real-World Examples {#real-world-examples}

Let's build some programs that solve real problems!

### Example 1: Tip Calculator
```rust
fn calculate_tip(bill_amount: Int, tip_percentage: Int) -> Int {
    let tip: Int = bill_amount * tip_percentage / 100;
    return tip;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Restaurant Tip Calculator ===");
    
    let bill: Int = 85;
    let tip_percent: Int = 18;
    
    let tip_amount: Int = calculate_tip(bill, tip_percent);
    let total: Int = bill + tip_amount;
    
    println("Bill amount: $" + bill);
    println("Tip (" + tip_percent + "%): $" + tip_amount);
    println("Total to pay: $" + total);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Simple Password Strength Checker
```rust
fn check_password_length(password: String, min_length: Int) -> Int {
    // This is a simplified version - in real code, you'd check actual length
    // For now, we'll simulate different password strengths
    let length: Int = 8; // Simulated length
    
    if length >= min_length {
        println("✅ Password length is good");
        return 1;
    } else {
        println("❌ Password too short");
        return 0;
    }
}

fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Password Strength Checker ===");
    
    let user_password: String = "mypassword123";
    let required_length: Int = 8;
    
    println("Checking password: " + user_password);
    
    let length_ok: Int = check_password_length(user_password, required_length);
    
    if length_ok >= 1 {
        println("🎉 Password meets requirements!");
    } else {
        println("⚠️ Please choose a stronger password");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Simple Budget Tracker
```rust
fn calculate_remaining_budget(income: Int, expenses: Int) -> Int {
    let remaining: Int = income - expenses;
    return remaining;
}

fn budget_status(remaining: Int) -> Int {
    if remaining >= 500 {
        println("💰 Great! You have plenty left over");
    } else if remaining >= 100 {
        println("👍 You're doing okay");
    } else if remaining >= 0 {
        println("⚠️ Getting tight, watch your spending");
    } else {
        println("🚨 You're over budget!");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Monthly Budget Tracker ===");
    
    let monthly_income: Int = 3500;
    let rent: Int = 1200;
    let food: Int = 400;
    let utilities: Int = 200;
    let transportation: Int = 300;
    let entertainment: Int = 250;
    
    let total_expenses: Int = rent + food + utilities + transportation + entertainment;
    let remaining: Int = calculate_remaining_budget(monthly_income, total_expenses);
    
    println("Monthly Income: $" + monthly_income);
    println("Total Expenses: $" + total_expenses);
    println("Remaining: $" + remaining);
    
    budget_status(remaining);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## What Makes Neksis Special {#what-makes-neksis-special}

### 1. Type Safety
Neksis catches many errors before your program runs:
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    let age: Int = 25;
    let name: String = "Alice";
    
    // This works - combining string with number
    println("Age: " + age);
    
    // The compiler prevents mistakes like trying to do math with text
    // let result: Int = age + name;  // This would cause an error!
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Performance
Neksis programs run fast because they're compiled, not interpreted:
- **Compiled languages** (like Neksis): Your code is translated to machine code once, then runs at full speed
- **Interpreted languages** (like Python): Your code is translated line-by-line while it runs, which is slower

### 3. Memory Efficiency
Neksis manages memory automatically but efficiently:
```rust
fn main() -> Int {
    println("=== Memory Efficiency Demo ===");
    
    // Neksis automatically manages memory for these variables
    let large_number: Int = 1000000;
    let calculation: Int = large_number * 2;
    
    println("Large calculation: " + calculation);
    
    // Memory is automatically cleaned up when variables go out of scope
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Common Patterns {#common-patterns}

### Pattern 1: Input Validation
```rust
fn validate_age(age: Int) -> Int {
    if age >= 0 && age <= 150 {
        println("Valid age: " + age);
        return 1;
    } else {
        println("Invalid age: " + age);
        return 0;
    }
}

fn main() -> Int {
    validate_age(25);   // Valid
    validate_age(-5);   // Invalid
    validate_age(200);  // Invalid
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Pattern 2: Menu Systems
```rust
fn show_menu() -> Int {
    println("=== Main Menu ===");
    println("1. View Profile");
    println("2. Settings");
    println("3. Help");
    println("4. Exit");
    return 0;
}

fn handle_choice(choice: Int) -> Int {
    if choice == 1 {
        println("📱 Opening Profile...");
    } else if choice == 2 {
        println("⚙️ Opening Settings...");
    } else if choice == 3 {
        println("❓ Opening Help...");
    } else if choice == 4 {
        println("👋 Goodbye!");
    } else {
        println("❌ Invalid choice");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    show_menu();
    handle_choice(2);  // User chose Settings
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Pattern 3: Data Processing
```rust
fn process_sales_data(day1: Int, day2: Int, day3: Int) -> Int {
    let total: Int = day1 + day2 + day3;
    let average: Int = total / 3;
    
    println("=== Sales Report ===");
    println("Day 1: $" + day1);
    println("Day 2: $" + day2);
    println("Day 3: $" + day3);
    println("Total: $" + total);
    println("Average: $" + average);
    
    if average >= 1000 {
        println("🎉 Great sales week!");
    } else {
        println("📈 Room for improvement");
    }
    
    return total;
}

fn main() -> Int {
    process_sales_data(850, 920, 1100);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Common Error Messages and Solutions

#### Error: "Expected field name"
**What it means:** Usually a syntax error with operators or missing semicolons

**Example of problem:**
```rust
// Wrong - missing semicolon
let x: Int = 5
println(x);
```

**Solution:**
```rust
// Correct - added semicolon
let x: Int = 5;
println(x);
```

#### Error: "Cannot perform arithmetic on non-numeric value"
**What it means:** You're trying to do math with text

**Example of problem:**
```rust
// Wrong - trying to add text and number incorrectly
let name: String = "Alice";
let result: Int = name + 5;  // This doesn't work
```

**Solution:**
```rust
// Correct - using proper string concatenation
let name: String = "Alice";
let age: Int = 5;
println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Read error messages carefully** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check your semicolons** - Every statement needs one
3. **Match your parentheses and braces** - Every `{` needs a `}`
4. **Check variable types** - Make sure you're using `Int` for numbers and `String` for text

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive variable names:**
   ```rust
   // Good
   let student_age: Int = 20;
   let course_name: String = "Introduction to Programming";
   
   // Not so good
   let x: Int = 20;
   let s: String = "Course";
   ```

2. **Add comments to explain complex logic:**
   ```rust
   fn main() -> Int {
       // Calculate compound interest
       let principal: Int = 1000;
       let rate: Int = 5;  // 5% interest rate
       let years: Int = 3;
       
       // Simple interest calculation for demonstration
       let interest: Int = principal * rate * years / 100;
       
       println("Interest earned: $" + interest);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Break complex problems into functions:**
   ```rust
   // Instead of one big main function, break it up:
   
   fn calculate_tax(income: Int) -> Int {
       let tax_rate: Int = 20;  // 20% tax rate
       let tax: Int = income * tax_rate / 100;
       return tax;
   }
   
   fn calculate_net_income(income: Int) -> Int {
       let tax: Int = calculate_tax(income);
       let net: Int = income - tax;
       return net;
   }
   
   fn main() -> Int {
       let gross_income: Int = 50000;
       let net_income: Int = calculate_net_income(gross_income);
       
       println("Gross: $" + gross_income);
       println("Net: $" + net_income);
       
       return 0;
   }
   ```
